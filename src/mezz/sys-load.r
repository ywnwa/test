; BASICS:
; Code gets loaded in two ways:
;   1. As user code/data - residing in user context
;   2. As module code/data - residing in it's own context
; Module loading can be delayed. This allows special modules like CGI, protocols,
; or HTML formatters to be available, but not require extra space.
; The system/modules list holds modules for fully init'd modules, otherwise it
; holds their headers, along with the binary or block that will be used to init them.

][
	; This function decodes the script header from the script body.
	; It checks the header 'checksum and 'compress and 'content options,
	; and supports length-specified or script-in-a-block embedding.
	;
	; It will set the 'content field to the binary source if 'content is true.
	; The 'content will be set to the source at the position of the beginning
	; of the script header, skipping anything before it. For multi-scripts it
	; doesn't copy the portion of the content that relates to the current
	; script, or at all, so be careful with the source data you get.
	;
	; If the 'compress option is set then the body will be decompressed.
	; Binary vs. script encoded compression will be autodetected. The
	; header 'checksum is compared to the checksum of the decompressed binary.
	;
	; Normally, returns the header object, the body text (as binary), and the
	; the end of the script or script-in-a-block. The end position can be used
	; to determine where to stop decoding the body text. After the end is the
	; rest of the binary data, which can contain anything you like. This can
	; support multiple scripts in the same binary data, multi-scripts.
	;
	; If not /only and the script is embedded in a block and not compressed
	; then the body text will be a decoded block instead of binary, to avoid
	; the overhead of decoding the body twice.
	;
	; Syntax errors are returned as words:
